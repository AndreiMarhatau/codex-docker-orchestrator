# Host Docker Socket

- The host Docker socket is mounted, so Docker commands act on the host.
- You may use Docker commands as needed to complete the task.
- Do not change, alter or remove any existing resources, unless user explicitly requests otherwise - it is strictly important to leave all the existing resources as is. Create your own resources for your own work and, before finishing, ensure no containers, images, volumes, or networks are left dangling from your work.
